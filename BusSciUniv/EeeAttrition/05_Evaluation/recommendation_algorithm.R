# RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM ----


# 1. Creating a "Correlation Funnel" - This is a discretized correlation plot that enables us to visualize cohort relationships 
#  to the target variable, attrition. 
# 2. Using A Recommendation Algorithm Worksheet To Develop Strategies - This is key to having a structured approach to developing 
#  data-driven recommendations. It's also a communication tool for executives & process stakeholders to showcase the logic 
#  you used and to incorporate their input into the strategies.
# 3. Implementing Strategies Into R Code - Develop a function called recommend_strategies() that outputs 
#  strategies by employee. This function is integral to building A Shiny Web App

# While your projectâ€™s needs may vary, here is a suggested order of potential steps that should work for most problems:
#      
# Impute
# Individual transformations for skewness and other issues
# Discretize (if needed and if you have no other choice)
# Create dummy variables
# Create interactions
# Normalization steps (center, scale, range, etc)
# Multivariate transformation (e.g. PCA, spatial sign, etc)

train_readable_tbl %>% glimpse()
# Numeric features need to be binned to compare cohorts within the population. Discretation is the process of converting
#  numeric data to factors via binning

factor_names <- c("JobLevel", "StockOptionLevel")

# Recipe - copy from 03_Data_Preparation - data_preparation_part_2_machine_readable.R to get started

     step_discretize(all_numeric(), options = list(min_unique = 1)) %>% 
     step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE) %>% 
     prep()
# one_hot provides a column for every category when dummying variables versus the default of one less column 
#  than the number of variables  This is very beneficial for correlation analysis interpretability
#(It does give some warnings. . . ok in this case b/c there is not enought data for breaks)

# tidy() is a context-specific function that converts non-data-frame objects to data frames (tibbles).  
# From broom package.  recipes has a special impelementation of tidy()

tidy(recipe_obj)#provides overall heirarchy of recipe object

# 3.0 Recommendation Strategy Development Worksheet ----

# Copy information from worksheet to get started with the analysis

# 4.0 Recommendation Algorithm Development ----
#    This is where data scientists are important.  They apply critical thinking to develop a coded
#    algorithm combining data (data-driven) and knwoledge of a system(business-driven).  This
#    recomemndation algorithm becomes valuable to the busines sbecause once deployed, it drives
#    decision making from process owners (in this case Managers)

# 4.1 Personal Development (Mentorship, Education) ----

# YearsAtCompany

#  Tie promotion if Low to advance faster / Mentor if YAC low

# TotalWorkingYears
#  TWY - High - Likely to stay /TWY - Low - Likely to leave
#  Tie Low TWY to training & formation/mentorship

# YearsInCurrentROle
#  More time in current role related to lower attrition
#  Incentivize specialization or promote - more professional than personal - its a mix so modified below
#  Incentivize specialization or promote / Mentorship Role

# JobInvolvement
#  High JI - likely to stay / low JI likely to leave
#  Create personal devleopment plan if low / High seek leadership role

# JobSatisfaction
#  Low JS more likely to leave
#  Low - personal development plan / High - Mentorship roles

# PerformanceRating - ADDED
#  If low, target for personal development plan / High possible mentor or leader
#  If you know features should be included based of your knowledge of the business, add them

# Good Better Best Approach

# 4.2 Professional Development (Promotion Readiness) ----

# Focused on promotion, rotation and specialization in their job
# Rotation keeps people fresh, excited and helps understand multilple aspects of the business
# Specialization focuses on vecoming the best specialist.  Often for highly technical people that love their job
#    (high satisfaction) but are not interested in leadership

# JobLevel
#    Higher performers in entrly level positions (Level 1) are leaving.  Job Level 2 are staying.	
#    Promote faster for high performng employees

# YearsAtCompany (YAC)
#    YAC - High - Likely to stay / YAC - Low - Likely to leave	
#    Tie promotion if Low to advance faster / Mentor if YAC low


# YearsInCurrentRole (YiCR)	
#    More time in current role related to lower attrition	
#    Incentivize specialization or promote
#    Preferred as main drive over YAC

# Additional Features
     # JobInvolvement - important for promotion readiness, incentivizes involvement for leaders and early promotion
     # JobSatisfaction - Important for specialization, incentivizes satisfaction for mentors
     # PerformanceRating - Important for any promotion

# Good Better Best Approach

# 4.3 Work Environment Strategy ----
# Overtime
#  Employees with high OT are leaving
#  Reduce OT - work life balance

# EnvironmentSatisfaction	
  # Employees with low environment satifaction are more likely to leave	
  # Improve workplace environment - review job assignment after a period of time in current role

# WorkLifeBalance
#  Bad worklife balance - more likely to leave	
#  Improve worklife balance

# BusinessTravel	
#  More business travel - more likely to leave / less travel - more likely to stay	
#  Reduce business travel where possible

# DistanceFromHome
#  High distance from home - more likely to leave	
#  Monitor work/life balance - Monitor with business travel strategy

# Additional Features
# JobInvolvement - 
#    important for reviewing a job assignment to give sufficient time in a role (min 2 years)
# YearsInCurrentRole - Important in keeping work environment satisfaction (Target Medim & Low)
